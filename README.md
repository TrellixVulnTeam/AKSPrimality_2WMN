# AKSPrimality

## The AKS(Agrawal-Kayal-Saxena) Primality Test published by Computer Scientists from IIT Kanpur in 2002 is the world's first primality proving algorithm to be simultaneously general,polynomial,deterministic and unconditional which won them the 2006 Godel Prize and 2006 Fulkerson Prize.

This is a python implementation of the same to find primes in a given range which uses memoisation of dynamic
programming technique to reduce the number of checks.
