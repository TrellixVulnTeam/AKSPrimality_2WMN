# AKSPrimality

## The AKS(Agrawal-Kayal-Saxena) Primality Test published by Computer Scientists from IIT Kanpur in 2002 is the world's first primality proving algorithm to be simultaneously general,polynomial,deterministic and unconditional.

This is a python implementation of the same to find primes in a given range which uses memoisation of dynamic
programming technique to reduce the number of checks.
